The `SEIRDataGenerator` class generates SEIR data for a given set of parameters, and the `DMDExperiment` class performs the DMD experiment on the generated SEIR data and returns the DMD modes. We have also defined two functions: `plot_SEIR_model` and `plot_DMD_modes`, which plot the SEIR model and DMD modes, respectively. \n\nThe `entrypoint.py` file is the entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the `SEIRDataGenerator` class, generates SEIR data, creates an instance of the `DMDExperiment` class, runs the DMD experiment, and plots the SEIR model and DMD modes using the `plot_SEIR_model` and `plot_DMD_modes` functions, respectively. The generated png files are saved in the current working directory."}]
