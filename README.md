## Setup

1) Make sure you have an OpenAI [ChatGPT API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2) Login to or sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com) account
3) Create a fork of this [live coding session materials repository](https://github.com/mgm79/AI-Institute-June-2023-Workshop) (ETA < 60 seconds)<br>[![fork](/media/fork.png)]([https://github.com/mgm79/AI-Institute-June-2023-Workshop](https://github.com/mgm79/AI-Institute-June-2023-Workshop))
4) Start up a [codespace](https://github.com/codespaces) for editing and running the code (opening the link in a new window is recommended)<br>[![codespace](/media/codespace.png)](https://github.com/codespaces)<br>Select your fork of the session repository (try entering "AI-Institute" to find your forked repository)<br>![repository](/media/repository.png)<br>Bump system specs to 4-core 8GB RAM<br>![machine](/media/machine.png)<br>ETA 10-15 seconds
5) Navigate (on the left) to the `.ipynb` file and click `kernel`. This will bring up a dialog in the lower right corner of the window. Select install - note that this is installing into the remote codespace, _not_ onto your local computer.<br>![python extension](/media/python-extension.png)
